# Contributing

We're open to pull requests for additional tooling, but it must be relevant to static web site development.

## Pull Request Process

1. Increase the version number in VERSION, following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
2. Update the README.md and HISTORY.md files with details of changes
3. The Pull Request can be merged once Travis CI has successfully done a build
4. Travis CI will automatically release a new version, and the website will automatically be updated via GitHub Pages.
